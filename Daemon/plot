chapter 1:
	introduced to "john connor", Notre J Ahe, during a motivational speech, gets cut his head sliced in half (by his eyes, where trojan's headband is) by "The Trojan", who looks like Anti Mage's "Guilt of the survivor" set, both sport the headband, notre has it above his head, trojan's covers his eyes, trojon says an "iconic line", bass increases (like in tenet) cut to black,

	rush to the teleporter, go to the main base, only to discover it being ravaged by the bots, 

	ACT 1:
		[ THERE IS A TIME LIMIT ]
		You have to get to the elevator which is going to the basement bunker, it is a bullet hell, mixed with metroidvaniac aspects (not a lot though), you find the elevator blocked by a lot of rubble,so you have to find the PHASE BOOTS, and then make it back, make some purposedly hidden passages for people who want to explore.
	
	ACT 2:
		You get in the elevator, only for it to be infiltrated by Trojan BLINKING in, and massacring everyone, someone blows the wires of the elevator in a desperate event and the lift plummets to the basement and only a few, you included survive, you are given a red pen drive by a leading executv to access his memory files in the server (final floor where you fell) to get the plans to defeat the trojan, and he closes off his transponder (the thing which transmits the data, or his memories to the server) thus killing himself as he doesnt want a death of suffering,

		As trojan is on the server floor he sends TUX a robot made for infiltration with some of the reductor robots to guard some areas, while he ensures that every human is dead 

		[ THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT ]
		In this act you have to play a pseudo horror game, sneak in and find the memory file of the executive, this is done in a pseudo 3d fashion, like in demonlocke
	
	ACT 3:
		When you steal the pendrive, trojan kills tux out of anger for destroying the servers in an attempt to stop you from stealing the data, but trojan doesnt listen to whatever tux has to say as he is extremely griefstricken and angry that he always fails regardless of how much he tries "his vulnerabilites", then he notices some bullet shells, which you fired, and realises someone else is down here too, he sets his mind to track and kill you he is extremely livid too, as his mission wasn't perfect and this was a big one, a big responsibility he failed to deliver as "BOSS" wanted.

		[THERE IS A TIME LIMIT], you have to find the secret machine, scavenge/forge 4 more red pendrives (or keys) to activate the weapon, then knock trojan into his subconcious, disorrienting him for some duration, thus weakning him, you and he converse during the bossfight, and learn about him, in his final stage he removes his bandana, where you see the skull of the trojan, i.e. the entirety of skin beneath the bandana has been removed, and he says "this is what god does to the ones who fuck up his work, and his work is divine", 
		
		In the fifth/final stage he starts regaining full control over his body, at this point a [A TIME LIMIT IS PUT ON THE BOSS FIGHT] you have to defeat trojan before he gets all the control.

		On death trojan's eye sockets have blood coming out, saying "I was acclaimed, respected once, once I almost saved my race, until god came down with his servants to kill us all, the same god who is destroying your beautiful world"

	PROLOGUE :
		See "god" realising someone under him has died, and then as if he knew who, he tried to feel trojan's presence, then he says "So, this is the progeny"
